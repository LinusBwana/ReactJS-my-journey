# ReactJS Learning Repository
Welcome to my ReactJS Learning Repository! 

This repo documents my ReactJS learning journey, featuring small projects, components, and experiments built to master core concepts from fundamentals to intermediate topics like state management, hooks, and component architecture. Each commit reflects hands-on practice with Reactâ€™s features and best practices, serving as a growing reference for my progress.

## What I have Done
- Set up my first React project using Vite and created basic components
- Created a Card component with an image, title, text, and styling
- Learnt three different CSS styling methods: *external stylesheets, inline styles, and CSS Modules*
- Built a Student component using *PropTypes* and *default props*
- Practiced conditional rendering using *props*, *defaultProps*, and *PropTypes*
- Rendered sorted and filtered lists with reusable List components
- Built Button and ProfilePicture components with click and double-click events
- Created Counter and MyComponent using the *useState* hook
- Used *updater functions* in *useState* to handle complex state updates and batching
- Handled controlled inputs for things like name, quantity, and payment
- Developed a ColorChange component with real-time background updates using *useState* and *onChange*
- Managed complex object and array state updates using *useState* and *updater functions*
- Built an interactive food list with *useState* and controlled inputs
- Managed an array of car objects with state and input control
- Created a basic To-Do List with add, delete, and reorder functionality
- Used *useEffect* to update the document title based on state
- Built a window size tracker with *useEffect* and cleanup logic
- Created a digital clock using *useEffect*
- Shared state globally using the React Context API (*useContext*)
- Used *useRef* to control input fields without causing re-renders
- Built a stopwatch using *useRef* and interval logic
- Added a *save-to-localStorage* feature for the to-do list app
